Code for multivariate analysis of behavioral variables

Used in the article: Oliveira-Junior et al. Multidimensional behavioral profiles associated with resilience and susceptibility after inescapable stress. Scientific Reports (2024).
 
OBS: This script was designed to run all analyses and generate all results and figures in a single run using the data from the file 'Data_Table.xlsx', available at: https://osf.io/mgknc. You may run the entire script or each section separately in order. To run this script you need to add the 'utilities' folder with custom scripts in the path. Note that for analyses based on randomly selecting partitioned data, the results may slightly vary between runs.
